[![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Site-View%20Demo-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel)](https://capsules-website-remake.vercel.app/)

This is a high-fidelity remake of the **Capsules¬Æ website**, built from scratch to explore and master advanced front-end animations. This project was a month-long labor of love, focusing on replicating complex scroll-based and interactive effects using the GSAP library.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Animations

This project wasn't just about looks; it was a deep dive into animation logic. Here are some of the key features implemented:

* **Preloader:** A custom logo and progress bar animation to start the experience.
* **Hero Text Reveal:** Staggered character reveal on all main headings using `SplitText`.
* **Stacking Cards:** A complex `ScrollTrigger` animation where cards stack, scale, and fade on scroll.
* **Horizontal Scroll:** A sticky horizontal scroll section for the "Activities" slider, complete with parallax image effects.
* **Magnetic Button:** A button that follows the cursor on hover (Page 5).
* **Dynamic Marquees:** Text marquees that change direction based on the user's scroll direction.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented with `Lenis` for a modern, fluid user experience.
* **Fully Responsive:** A clean, responsive design that adapts to all screen sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The animations and smooth scrolling are powered by a few key libraries:

* **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** The core engine for all JavaScript animations.
* **ScrollTrigger:** The GSAP plugin for creating all scroll-based animations.
* **Lenis:** For that smooth, precise scrolling feel.
* **SplitText:** The GSAP plugin used for the text reveal animations.
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the structure and styling.

## üå± Project Journey & Learnings

This project was a personal challenge that took over a **month to complete**. The main goal was to move beyond basic animations and tackle professional, complex interactions. The stacking card sequence, in particular, was a major learning experience in managing multiple ScrollTrigger timelines.

It was built with a lot of love and (many) late nights of debugging!
